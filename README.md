# MOBILE APP FOR ‘THIS OR THAT’

# PROBLEM SOLVED
Our app answers the question for an indecisive user:
Which one of these two things should I choose?

# MVP:
A thread of usage:
The posting user wants to see a poll of what people would choose between 2 items.  These items can be in a given category.  What thing should I buy?  What movie should I see?  Where should I eat?  The user has narrowed it down to 2, but wants some help and recommendations before making a final selection.

The posting user takes a picture of the 2 items, and potentially makes a comment about their choices.

The voting user sees a gallery of the open posts, and can vote on one of the two choice between the 2 choices, for whichever posts that they want to.  They can potentially make comments about their votes.

The posting user sees what the current poll answers are for their posts, as well as seeing galleries of open posts that they can vote on.

The posting user can delete posts.
